### Decoding Brain Dynamics Across Scales

*From neural activity to meaningful spatiotemporal patterns*

We capture large-scale neural activity in healthy and brain-damaged models to understand how brain networks function, fail, and recover. Using high-density electrophysiology, stimulation, and advanced analysis, we build a unique library of multiscale neural dynamics.

- Large-scale in vivo datasets (spikes & LFP)
- Multiscale analysis of activity, connectivity, and recovery
- Biological ground truth for modeling and validation

### Building Biomimetic Neural Intelligence

*From biological data to realistic spiking neural networks*

We translate real brain dynamics into biologically grounded spiking neural network models. By tuning neurons, synapses, connectivity, and plasticity, we reproduce healthy and damaged brain behavior in both software and real-time hardware.

- Data-driven SNN models of brain networks
- Optimization of neural and synaptic parameters
- Real-time neuromorphic hardware implementations

### Adaptive Biohybrid Neuromorphic Systems

*Closing the loop between living and artificial networks*

We integrate biological and artificial neural systems into a unified real-time platform. Through closed-loop interaction and damage-response experiments, we demonstrate adaptability, resilience, and self-repair.

- Real-time encoding of biological signals into spikes
- Bidirectional interaction between brain tissue and SNNs
- Validation of adaptability and resilience under damage
