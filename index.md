## About the Project {#about}

The BIONIC project seeks to revolutionize security and critical infrastructure protection through the development of a biohybrid intelligent system that mimics the behavior of a real brain.

Leveraging neuromorphic and biomimetic computing architectures, the project will emulate the brain's in vivo functionality, creating an adaptive computing platform capable of learning and being trained by a real biological brain.

By integrating biologically realistic spiking neural network models with real-time neuromorphic hardware, BIONIC aims to reproduce key features of brain dynamics such as adaptability, robustness, and recovery after damage.

The project will deliver groundbreaking technology able to overcome key limitations of current approaches in replicating the brain’s resilience.

- Scientific workshops, conferences, and public events
- Engagement with end-users and technology transfer offices

### Featured Workshop

**A Neuromorphic and Neurostimulation Approach for Sensorimotor Restoration**

This workshop addresses the challenge of restoring meaningful sensorimotor integration through peripheral nerve stimulation and intracortical microstimulation (ICMS), with a focus on neuromorphic and closed-loop approaches for rehabilitation and neuroprosthetics.

**Speakers include:**
- Prof. Federico Barban — University of Genova, Italy
- Dr. Marta Carè — IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Italy
- Dr. Mark Iskarous — University of Chicago, USA
- Prof. Elisa Donati — Institute of Neuroinformatics, UZH & ETH Zurich, Switzerland
- Prof. Luke Osborn — Case Western Reserve University, USA
